        * Create a program that will ask the user about a solar system planet they want to visit.
        * And calculate the weight according to the user choose that they would have there.
        * The weight might be calculated using the following formula: weight = mass * surface gravity.
        * The "mass", "planet" should be asked from the user using Scanner class.
        * You MUST use only the different flavors of the "if" operator in this task.*/
